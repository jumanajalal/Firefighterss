# Project Name
This project aims to develop a comprehensive personal finance tracker that leverages machine learning techniques to provide 
users with actionable insights and proactive financial management tools. The system will enable users to manage their expenses 
effectively, set budget goals, and receive predictive analyses of their future spending patterns. This project is essential for 
individuals seeking to improve their financial literacy and manage their finances effectively. By automating expense tracking, 
offering predictive insights, and providing proactive financial advice, the tracker empowers users to make informed financial 
decisions and work towards their financial goals. The combination of machine learning and user-centric design makes this

## How it Works ?
The Personal Finance Tracker with Predictive Insights operates by collecting transactional data from user-linked accounts 
or manual inputs. Using machine learning, expenses are categorized automatically into specific budgeting categories. 
Users can then set budget goals for each category, with the system providing real-time monitoring against these goals 
and sending alerts as needed. Historical spending data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms to generate predictive 
insights into future spending patterns. Users receive actionable recommendations and progress updates on financial goals 
through a user-friendly interface accessible on web or mobile platforms.
